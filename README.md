# rotvic-blog

Personal blog system. 

### Version
0.1.0

### Deployment

```sh
$ git clone [git-repo-url] 
$ cd rotvic-blog
$ npm install
```

- Open config.json and ensure mongodburi is pointing to a valid mongodb server url. Make other changes in the config if needed.
- Run the file ./bin/www 

### Further development

As you can see, a lot of standard features are missing as of now. I plan to make the blog a little more robust(posting comments, file upload, social media integration etc.) than it is now and also make it a little more secure.
